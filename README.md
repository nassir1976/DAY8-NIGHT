# DAY8-NIGHT

We would like to build an app that will allow us to enjoy our date night by going through D8 Night app and selecting the categories that are important to us based on the selection that is given.


An application for users to help them select from various categories in order to plan out the perfect date night. Users may search between categories of recipes, cocktails, movies, tv shows, workout ideas, nearby events, music playlists, and finding a new book to share. 


MVP:
  + We would like to have a minimum of 3 APIs to set our categories to choose from
  + We will use routes to access the APIs and narrow down the selection within each category
  + Our app will then display your results from your categories and save your selections into our SQL database.
  + Deploy on Heroku.
  + This additional Bare minimum CSS will include a flexbox and grid CSS.
  + Bare minimum JS will include building our server, using appropriate dependencies, using routes to access APIs, storing favorite events in SQL will display         using ejs.
