# Software Requirements: DAY8 NIGHT 

## Vision:
Our vision of this app is to create a one-stop shop for planning a date night.

## What We Are Solving:
Planning dates can be hard.  DAY8 Night facilitates the planning of a date, by providing the user with a variety of traditional components of a date, in one site, to help the user plan the best date night (or day!) ever.

## Why You Should Care:
Whether you are dating, happily married, or just matched with someone on Tinder... this app will help guide the planning of a date night.

## Scope IN
  - This app will provide recipe, movie, music, cocktail and TV show results (based on genre) to the user.
  - This app will allow the user to "favorite" results, creating a library of potential date ideas.
  - This app will allow the user to remove "favorite" results.

## Scope OUT
  - 

## Minimum Viable Product
MVP will incorporate 5 API's (recipe, movie, music, cocktail and TV show) to generate queried results to the user based on their genre specifications.  For example: an Italian recipe or a romantic comedy.

## Stretch Goals
Stretch goals will incporate all 8 API's.  In addition to the 5 API's we would like to incporate book, event and work out API generated date ideas.

## Functionality
  1. A user can search date topics based on their interests.
  2. A user can store searches that appeal to them.
  3. A user can view, add and deleted their saved searches.
